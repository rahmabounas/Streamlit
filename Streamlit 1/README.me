## üìñ Dataset Description

Expresso is an African telecommunications services company operating in **Mauritania** and **Senegal**.  
The dataset contains information about approximately **2.5 million clients**, capturing their behavior through **more than 15 variables**.  

The main objective is to **predict the probability of customer churn**, helping the company better understand and anticipate customer departures.
